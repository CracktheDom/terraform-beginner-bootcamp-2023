Semantic versioning is a system for assigning version numbers that conveys meaning about the code changes in each new release. It follows a **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** format, e.g. `1.0.1`:

- MAJOR version - Incremented when incompatible API changes are made. This signals breaking changes.

- MINOR version - Incremented when backwards-compatible functionality is added. No existing code should break.

- PATCH version - Incremented when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made.

Additional labels can be attached for pre-release and build metadata.

Some key principles of semantic versioning:

- Versions should be parsed and compared easily by programs.

- Clearly communicates impact of updates for users and maintainers.

- Flexible for varied development workflows.

- Provides an easy way to set version dependencies.

Overall, semantic versioning provides a standardized, semantic system for version numbers that gives meaning to each version bump. This helps manage expectations around updates and reduces version number confusion. It has become a very common versioning approach, especially for open source libraries and APIs.
